<h1> Alan Sage Furth </h1>
<h3> Globally focused, locally rooted, and driven towards making an impact. </h3>

<p> I work with the fundamental belief that professional and altruistic ambitions are consistent rather than contradictory concepts. My goal is to work with organizations and projects that are inherently responsible, impactful, and successful. With a background in internationally focused non-profits, I approach every challenge with the notion that the best solutions are collaborative efforts from people with shared goals and different perspectives. </p>

<p> I graduated from Colorado State University with a Bachelor in History, providing me with a unique outlook in such a forward thinking industry. Growing up overseas, I have a great love of travel and a deep respect for other cultures. And while my mind is always globally focused, my heart is rooted in Colorado. </p>

<p> I am enticed by the startup industry’s energetic and innovative approach to tomorrow’s challenges. When the stakes are starkly fast or famine, it attracts individuals who are creative and inspired. Progress comes from that type of environment and it is with those people that I believe I can best pursue personal and professional goals. </p>
